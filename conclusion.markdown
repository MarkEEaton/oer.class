#Conclusion

Open Electronic Resources (OER) have advantages for faculty and students. For students, it all but guarantees access to course materials, and presents a significant cost savings. For faculty, it represents the chance to explore and modify new content and to expand one's pedagogical reach, moving from teaching students around an institution to potentially teaching students from around the world.

This class has hopefully given you the tools to take the next step into OER.
